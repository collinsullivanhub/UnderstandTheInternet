<p>"The world is a jungle in general, and the networking game contributes many animals" - RFC 826</p>
<p>The goal of this site is to help spread knowledge and increase every person's understanding of the internet.</p>

<p>Networks, and the protocols that have been designed as specifications for how they are to operate and transmit data, are often overlooked or taken for granted by most people. This is expected. A regular person often doesn't need to know how their data is successfully transmitted, they just need it to work in the same way they expect their electrical provider to always work. If you want to truly understand how networks and protocols operate in detail, this will be a great introduction!</p>

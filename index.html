<p><i>"The world is a jungle in general, and the networking game contributes many animals" - RFC 826</i></p>
<h3><b>The goal of this site is to help spread knowledge and increase every person's understanding of the internet and the technology which comprises it.</b></h3>

<p>Like the jungle is filled with many varities of plants and animals that each have their unique traits, strengths, weaknesses, and contribution to the
  greater ecosystem, the internet is comprised of a variety of networks and devices which similarly have their own physical limitations and advantages which
  manifest as a complex, interconnected digital ecosystem. The internet has become akin to electricity in that people expect it to be performant with minimal
  downtime as it is a crucial part of our daily lives, but increasingly have less understanding of how it works.

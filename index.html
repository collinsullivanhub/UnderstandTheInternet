<p>"The world is a jungle in general, and the networking game contributes many animals" - RFC 826</p>
<p>The goal of this site is to help spread knowledge and increase every person's understanding of the internet.</p>

<p>Networks and the protocols that have been designed as specifications for how they are to operate and transmit data are often overlooked or taken <br>
for granted by most people. This is expected. In the same way that an old lady doesn't need to know how the electrical components in her dish washer <br>
operate to wash her clothes a regular person often doesn't need to know how their data is successfully transmitted, they just need it to work.<br>

<p><i>"The world is a jungle in general, and the networking game contributes many animals" - RFC 826</i></p>

<p>Like the jungle is composed of many varities of plants and animals, the internet is made up of a variety of networks and protocols. Networks, and the protocols that have been designed as specifications for how they are to operate and transmit data,
  are often overlooked or taken for granted by most people. This is expected. A regular person often doesn't need to
  know how their data is successfully transmitted, they just need it to work in the same way that they would expect their electrical
  provider to consistently work with minimal downtime. The goal of this site is to explain the internet, the networks, devices, and protocols it's composed of.</p>

    <h2>Introduction to the Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>

    <p>
    When most people browse the internet to their favorite websites, they are typically clicking on an icon for that site in their web browser or start to
    type the name of the site into their browser, which then auto-completes, allowing then to press the enter button on the keyboard without thinking much about it
    to take them to that site.
    </p>
    <p>
    Websites are represented by a recognizeable domain which is easy for someone to remember that correlates to an IP address of a web server which actually
    will provide the data they are expecting from that webpage. For example, when I want to go to my banking website I know I can search for "Bank of America"
    in my browser, which provides an easily recognizeable domain: bankofamerica.com
    </p>
    <p>
    This domain is <i>far easier</i> to remember and recognize than the front-end server IP address 171.161.148.150. Imagine if you had to remember all of the IP
    addresses for all of your commonly visited sites! It would be incredibly difficult. For this reason, domains were created to be more human-friendly.

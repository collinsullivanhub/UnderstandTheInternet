    <h2>Load Balancers</h2>

    <p>
    I'm sure that just like me you have at one point been at an intersection and thought, "Wow, this light is taking forever..."
    </p>
    <p>
    While networks and packets are not exactly similar to vehicle traffic in metropolitan areas, they certainly are analogous in many ways. When we sit at a long light at an intersection it is usually due to a high amount of traffic at the time. When we sit at a very short light, usually early in the morning or 
    late at night, it is usually due to a low amount of traffic. Similarly, when network congestion increases services typically slow down. While 
    they are not at a literal traffic intersection, they do "sit still" manifested as propogation, processing, and queueing delays coupled with packet loss due to discards.
    </p>
    <p>
    A load balancer is a device or software component that acts as an intermediary between client devices (such as web browsers or mobile devices) and a group of backend servers or resources.

    It receives incoming network traffic, intelligently distributes it across multiple servers based on predefined algorithms and rules, and forwards the traffic to the appropriate server. Load balancers also monitor the health and availability of servers, directing traffic away from servers that are experiencing issues or are unavailable.
